# personal portfolio website
This website is going to showcase my projects that I've completed while at Prime Digital Academy.
My plan is to include a quote of the day that is randomly generated and shown on the home page, have hover states for
the project images on the home page. The images link to the specific project part on the project page from the home page.

## The assignment
Its time to start building your personal site!
A place for you to lovingly post all your hard work. Don't worry, we are not looking for completion, but rather the start of something great.

Using Angular Client Side routing and everything else you have learned to date, start building out a mutli-page, single page architected website. Include sections that speak to your interests and we will start to shape this later.

Know that we will present these in class tomorrow morning, so please come ready to show others. There are not a whole lot of requirements or constraints around this. Totally on you to start stubbing out what you would want to include on a site about you.

Hard Mode
Style it all up with all the things you know about Bootstrap
